We have designed a prototype for preserving our heritage and hence culture. We provide every person and every visiter who is ready to help in 
this initiative a chance to help us and country by just clicking a pic of the place or parts of the monuments he finds destructed or damanged in any form and then uplaod it on our website.
As soon as the user does his work of uplaoding the pic, we make sure that the complaint goes to the related authorities and a required action is quickly taken for it.
Complaint status is also available on the website for each complaint/pic any user uplaods so the interested people can have access to the detailed reaction to their complaint.
Let's get together to take a small step and see bigger changes.
Let's help our country to preserve it's heritage with the same essence and fragrance.
